I often get questions about our development workflow at shopware. 
So I think it might be interesting to give you a little insight in our process.
 
As software company, we try to cover the whole development process with an agile culture.
Most of our teams are using Scrum and we try to strictly follow the agile manifesto??? link

But in an agile culture it is difficult to adapt the tradional testing methods.
Like most of the development companies we also had an separate testing department.
So it seems as would a faster development process and good quality cancel each other out.

A few months ago I found a new approach developed and used by Atlassian. ??? Link https://www.atlassian.com/agile/how-to-deliver-quality-assurance-at-speed-video
